Spammer Detection and Fake User Identification on Social Networks
This project aims to detect spammer accounts and identify fake users on social networks using machine learning algorithms. It includes features to upload Twitter JSON format tweet datasets, analyze tweet text or URLs using Naive Bayes classifier, detect fake content, spam URLs, trending topics, and fake accounts, and perform prediction using various machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Extension Extreme Machine Learning (EML).

Features:
  Upload Twitter JSON format tweet datasets
  Analyze tweet text or URLs using Naive Bayes classifier
  Detect fake content, spam URLs, trending topics, and fake accounts
  Perform prediction using Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Extension Extreme Machine Learning (EML) algorithms
  Compare prediction accuracy of different algorithms
  Visualize detection results with graphs
